# IndustrialAlarmClock
Arduino code for the [Industrial Alarm Clock](https://www.hackster.io/insight-machines-laboratory/industrial-alarm-clock-47af49)

The code consists of three files: 
1. IndustrialAlarmClock.ino - main Arduino code for the device
2. sh1106.cpp - Driver code for the SH1106 chip that controls the OLED display used in the alarm clock
3. sh1106.h - SH1106 driver's header file

__NOTE: The SH1106 driver was created by Waveshare Team. We've made only a slight modification by adding a "setContrast" function__
